# z2tc — agent / contributor guide

**Zone 2 Track Club** training platform: Strava-backed ingestion, deterministic analysis (VDOT, paces, marathon-block reports), and a **pure** marathon week engine (Daniels 2Q + Pfitzinger). The numeric plan path has **no LLM** — same `AthleteInputs` always yields the same `TrainingPlan`.

**Python:** use a **3.11–3.13** venv (see `README.md`). Playwright + `greenlet` do not support 3.14 yet.

## What `output/` stores (generated artifacts)

Not version-controlled; layout depends on commands run:

- `output/athletes.jsonl` — `scrape` (one JSON object per athlete line).
- `output/training.jsonl` — default path for `training` (one ISO week per line).
- `output/training_summary.json` — `analyze` summary + calendar.
- `output/marathon/` — default `--out-dir` for `marathon-report`: `training_<id>.jsonl`, `report_<id>.json`, `marathon_reports.json`.
- `output/z2tc.db` — default SQLite store for athletes, survey baselines, `plan_artifacts` (with `engine_version`), append-only `events`, `training_blocks` (durable per-athlete history snapshots: raw scraped weeks + report + a demonstrated-capacity `profile`, keyed per marathon; also backs the dossier's race/feed history), append-only `narrative_renders` (deterministic-vs-LLM narrative capture for the distillation loop, linked to `plan_artifact_id`), append-only `publications` (plan-artifact → published sheet lineage), `weekly_actuals` (per-week run miles, upsert per `(season, week_start)`, so execution scoring replays from the store; written by `monitor` / `publish-sheet --training`), and a `config` kv (e.g. the cached club style bundle under `STYLE_BUNDLE_KEY`). `store/db.py`, `SCHEMA_VERSION` ↔ `PRAGMA user_version`; column adds handled by `_migrate()`.
- `output/club_workbook_style.json` — optional file copy of the `ingest-style` bundle (`style_spec` + `spreadsheet_id`). The store's `config` kv is the source of truth; `publish-sheet` / `publish-club` use an explicit `--style-bundle` file when present, else fall back to the store.
- Custom directories (e.g. per-athlete runs) follow the same per-file naming inside the chosen `--out-dir`. after `login`, Strava cookies live under `auth/` as Playwright storage state (see `feeds/strava/session.py`).

## Conventions

- **Determinism:** `engine/plan` is pure; regression tests lock behavior (same inputs → same plan). `engine.plan.ENGINE_VERSION` versions that behavior — bump it (with the updated `tests/test_plan.py` fixtures) when `build_plan` output can change for the same inputs; it's stamped onto every `plan_artifacts.engine_version`.
- **Club seam:** the per-coach generators in `engine/plan/` (Daniels, Pfitzinger, Hanson, Higdon) stay **pure/textbook**. Any cross-cutting coaching behavior that isn't one coach's own rule — i.e. anything *outside the coach engines* — must be wired into the **club engine** (`engine/plan/club.py`, `apply_club_policy`), not bolted onto a single generator or only the render layer. Production always builds through `build_club_plan` / `apply_club_policy` (`build-plan`, `start-season`, `replan`, `resolve_inputs`), so add new club-wide policy there as a resolvable default a coach override can still win over (mirror `weekday_quality_sessions`). New plan-affecting features belong here. Cross-cutting placement that must work for *every* method (e.g. seating tune-up races into the plan) is a **club post-process over the built plan** (`place_tune_up_races`, run by `build_club_plan`), not per-generator code — and it should defer to a method that already covers the behavior natively (Pfitzinger/Higdon prescribe their own tune-up races) rather than double up.
- **Strava:** manual login once; reuse `storage_state`; keep `--delay` reasonable.
- **Intake:** optional form fields are filled by `resolve_intake_defaults()` before `build_plan()`; full merge (Sheet row → `AthleteInputs`) is still a documented contract, not a single module.
- **Anti-duplication:** do not copy the full intake field matrix into other docs — link `docs/intake-and-engine.md`. CLI flag tables live in the cheatsheet; README keeps narrative + links.

After renames or new first-class modules, run `bin/check-doc-refs`.
